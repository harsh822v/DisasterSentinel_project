Functional Requirements for Natural Disaster Detection System
1. Disaster Detection & Monitoring
The system should fetch real-time seismic, weather, and satellite data to detect earthquakes, floods, and storms.
APIs (e.g., USGS, NOAA, OpenWeatherMap) should be integrated for continuous monitoring. AI/ML models should analyze patterns to detect early disaster warnings.
2. Live Alerts & Notifications
The system should provide real-time alerts for detected disasters via a dashboard and notifications.
users should receive push notifications, SMS, or email alerts based on their geolocation.
Alert severity levels (e.g., Advisory, Watch, Warning) should be categorized.
3. Geolocation-based Notifications
The system should detect a userâ€™s location (GPS/IP-based) to provide localized alerts.
A map interface should display nearby disasters, evacuation zones, and shelters.
Users should be able to manually input a location for disaster monitoring.
4. Disaster Footprint Tracker & Impact Visualization
The system should display past and ongoing disasters using a heatmap & GIS-based visualization.
Disaster footprints should be mapped using historical data + real-time updates.
The system should track disaster spread predictions using AI models.
5. Emergency Contact & Safety Guides
The system should provide emergency contacts for disaster relief organizations.
Users should have access to safety guides & preparedness tips for each type of disaster.
A chatbot should assist users in finding nearest shelters, hospitals, or emergency services.
6. User Authentication & Profiles
Users should be able to sign up, log in, and manage profiles.
Preferences for disaster alerts, locations, and notification methods should be customizable.
8. Admin Dashboard & Data Management
Admins should manage disaster alerts, API data sources, and user reports.
The system should store historical disaster data for analytics & reports.
9. System Performance & Reliability
The system should operate 24/7 with minimal downtime.
API requests should be optimized to avoid excessive load times.
Scalability should be considered for handling high user traffic during disaster events.
10. Security & Data Privacy
User data (e.g., location, contact info) should be encrypted and protected.
secure authentication (OAuth, JWT) should be implemented for user access.
API rate-limiting and access controls should prevent unauthorized data requests.
